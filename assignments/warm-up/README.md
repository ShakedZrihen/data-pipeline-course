# Warm up

As a data engineer, we want to be able to expose our collected data to the users

## Requirement

Build simple web api using python and Flask-API that will expose our collected data from ynet

the api should expose the following routes:

1. `/health` - will return 200 if the api is up
2. `/breaking-news` - will return all breaking news in the following format

```json
{
    "date": [{ "hour: news" }]
}
```

3. `/breaking-news?date=<date>` - will return all breaking news from specific date in the following format

```json
{
    "hour": "news"
}
```
